Codecademy's rock paper scissors JavaScript project.

~~**Not ready for deployment**~~ **Ready for Deployment**


A termianl rock, paper, scissors game written completely in JavaScript.

This was part of a practice project from Codecademy's full-stack development career path.

I added quite a bit of features above and beyond the scope of the project in order to create a more complete game.

~~**Current Issues**~~ **Resolved**

```
There is currently a reference error on line 53
> error: Uncaught ReferenceError: userInput is not defined.
I am not sure why this error is occuring. The previous method returns a defined userInput.
```
